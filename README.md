# MyAddingApp
This application is  a basic caclulator for children just learning to read. The operations are in words to assist with early congitive 
reading skills. I currently use this application for my son to teach him basic addition and substraction. Simultaneously he is learning 
expand his word base knowledge by reading the opeation word.
