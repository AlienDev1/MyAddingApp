# MyAddingApp
This application is  a basic caclulator for children just learning to read and basic mathmetics. The operations are in words to assist with early congitive 
reading skills. I currently use this application for my son to teach him basic addition and substraction. Simultaneously he is
expanding his word knowledge base by reading the opeational word.
